## FAQ

1. **Some files are being deleted and/or my anti-virus is detecting FPSUnlocker.exe as malware. What do I do?**

Any detections are most likely a false positive. If you don't trust me, feel free to download the repository and compile the project from source. Otherwise, add an exception to your anti-virus for `FPSUnlocker.exe` (or the folder it is in).

2. **How can I see my FPS?**

Press `Shift+F5` in-game to view your FPS. In Roblox Studio, go to View->Stats->Summary.

3. **How do I resolve choppiness and input lag at high framerates?**

Try entering fullscreen using `Alt+Enter`.

4. **I used this unlocker and my framerate is the same or below 60. Why?**

I say with great emphasis, as this seems to be a common misconception, that Roblox FPS Unlocker is an FPS _unlocker_ and not a _booster_. It will not boost Roblox's performance in any way and only removes Roblox's 60 FPS limit. To take advantage of RFU, a computer powerful enough to run Roblox at more than 60 FPS is required.

This being said, if you know your computer is powerful enough but still aren't seeing higher framerates with the unlocker, feel free to [submit an issue].

5. **Does this work for Mac?**

No. Roblox FPS Unlocker was written only for the Windows platform and I [currently have no plans to change this]. However, those more experienced and with Mac hardware are free to port this project to Mac!

6. **How do I uninstall Roblox FPS Unlocker?**

RFU does not install itself anywhere. It can be deleted by simply exiting the program if it is open (tray icon->Exit) and deleting `rbxfpsunlocker.exe`.
